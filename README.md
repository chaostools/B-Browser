 **Failed to add**
 * ðŸ˜“ zoom not working :not showing the buttons , when used with collasping action bar.
 * ðŸ˜“ the collapsing action of toolbar is bad on performance since nested scroll view is being used on an already scrollable web view( without nested scroll view, colapsing action won't work)
 * ðŸ˜“ Keyboard gets opened by default
 * ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡  SEARCHBAR IS FUCKING BAD: how cn i make this shit do: https://goo.gl/Zfm6K2
